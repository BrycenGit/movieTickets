## _Description_

Movie Tickets
Create a webpage where a user can select the name of a movie,
the time of day that they would like to see the movie
and their age.

The webpage should let them know how much their movie ticket will cost,
based on those three factors.
Consider that non-"first-release" movies,
matinee and senior tickets tend to be cheaper
than the regular priced ticket.

## drop down movie ticket spec
